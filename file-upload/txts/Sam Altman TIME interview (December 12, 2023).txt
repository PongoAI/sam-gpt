Sam thank you again for being here

backstage Sam said this was the most fun

thing he'd be doing all week so I hope

you don't the only fun moment Whole New

York this is great um we have a lot of

questions for you appreciate uh your

time the first one I think uh on the

minds of many people in the room tonight

uh what the hell

happened

um it's a good opener thank you a lot of

things it it's honestly it's been a

crazy whole year like in the context of

everything that has happened to us this

last 3 weeks or month or whatever it's

been it stands out but not as much as

you would think it should we we kind of

like went from this unknown research lab

to this like reasonably well-known tech

company in a year and I think that takes

most companies like 10 years and that's

been a wild experience to live through

um of course these last few weeks have

been particularly crazy uh and sort of

like painful and exhausting and happy to

like be back to work

um to say something like empathetic uh I

think everybody involved in this as we

get closer and closer to Super

intelligence um everybody involved gets

more stressed and more anxious and we

realize the stakes are higher and higher

and I think that all

exploded how do you think this moment

has changed open

AI um it's been extremely painful for me

personally but I actually think it's

been great for open AI um we've never

been more unified uh we have never been

more sort of determined and focused and

we always said that some Moment Like

This would come between where we were in

in in building AGI I didn't think it was

going to come so soon but I think we are

stronger for having gone through it uh

again I like wouldn't wish it on an

enemy but it it

did

it did have an extremely positive effect

on the company and what did you learn

from

it

um I haven't like fully recompiled

reality yet it like I didn't I haven't

had the time to like emotionally process

all of this because it was like it all

happened so fast and then I had to like

come back in and pick up the pieces um

that I haven't had time to like sit down

and really reflect as much as I would

like but I I would say the most

important thing that I learned um you

know a thing I had always heard as like

a cliche or whatever is that your job as

a CEO is how much like the people you

hire and how much you sort of develop

and Mentor your team and the proudest

moment for me in all of this craziness

was realizing that the executive team

could totally run the company without me

I can go retire opening eye will be fine

and I'm super proud of the people to do

that and to watch them work at a time

where I couldn't really talk to them um

but they did an amazing

job really made me very proud and it

also made me very optimistic because I

think as we do get closer to artificial

general intelligence is the stakes

increase here um the ability for the

open AI team to operate

in uncertainty and stressful times is is

like really that should be of interest

to the world you you describing how high

the stakes are here what do you say to

someone who says this company brought

itself to the brink of

self-destruction how can we trust its

leader and how can we trust its company

with this transformative

technology um we have to make changes I

I we we always said that we didn't want

AGI to be controlled by a small set of

people we wanted to be democratized and

we clearly got that wrong so I think if

we don't make if we don't improve our

governance structure if we don't improve

our the way we interact with the world

people shouldn't but we're very

motivated to improve that on those

changes um your former uh co-founder

Elon Musk former person of the year um

has described open AI as a closed

sourced maximum profit company

effectively gr effectively controlled by

Microsoft uh is Elon

wrong on all of those

topics and any others you and you know I

actually in spite of his like constant

attacks on openi I'm very grateful that

Elon exists in the world I think why

because I think he's done some amazing

things I I think the transition to

electric vehicles is super important um

I think getting to space is super

important

uh and I'm grateful for those things you

know we're definitely not maximum profit

seeking although you could talk to Elon

about some of his Ventures for that one

um and we open source a lot of stuff

will open source more in the future and

we're certainly not controlled by

Microsoft

um and I think all

that is something that someone can say

but does not actually reflect the truth

um a thought on a question about another

competitor Google released Gemini last

week um a model that Google claims

outperforms GPT for on many performance

tests what do you make of Gemini and why

did it take them so long to release

it I'm happy for more people to be

making AI progress I think I think AI

will be the most the single most

transformative technology of this era

and so more people doing that I think is

great when the Big Gemini model I forget

what it's called I think Gemini Ultra

when that gets released sometime next

year we'll get to look at it I can weigh

in on it then um certainly there's been

a lot of confusion around the metrics

but I'm I'm I'm sure Google will do

great work uh in an interview earlier

this year with Edward Felsenthal you

said uh my my predecessor As Time

editor-in Chief you said I am a

Midwestern Jew I think that fully

explains my mental model yeah that's

like is that true you still feel that

way no I think it's like a compressed

one sentence to like explain everything

about what I I think that's pretty good

as a um as a New England Jew I have to

ask you um how does Judy judism shape

your worldview and what has it been like

to been a Jewish leader since October

7th you know if you had asked me this

question at the beginning of the year um

I would have said there's all of these

like subtle but important cultural

things that have I think shaped my

worldview and how I act and how I sort

of live my

life and I wouldn't have talked about

anything other than that and one of one

of the weird things about being Jewish

and getting internet famous is like most

of your online experience is people

saying like horrible things about Jews

and I don't know if that was always the

case or if that's like ramped up but

that's certainly been my experience this

year and on double time since o since

the last couple of months

um I think I was just like wrong to be

so dismissive of this I was like look

anti-Semitism we're done with that the

world has moved on there's other

problems let's talk about those and I

have really seen in this this last year

and particularly in this last couple of

months that I was just completely wrong

about that and it's like a sad sad thing

for the world you're someone who likes

to take on intractable problems as

you've thought about that you know how

do you think about Solutions towards

that that one seems harder than

AGI uh speaking of difficult problems uh

next year is a historic year for

democracy there will be elections in 40

countries um are you concerned at all

about ai's ability to contribute to

disinformation and or do you have do you

think there are specific conerns that

we're not concerns that you think we're

not taking seriously enough yeah

so I think AGI will be the most powerful

technology Humanity has yet invented and

like any other previous powerful

technology that will lead to incredible

new things I think we'll see education

change deeply and improved forever I

think the kids that start kindergarten

today by the time they graduate 12th

grade will be smarter and better

prepared than the best kids of today I

think that's great I think we talk about

the same thing in a lot of other things

Healthcare people who program for a

living a lot of other knowledge work but

there are going to be real

downsides and one of those I mean

there'll be many that we'll have to

mitigate but one of those is going to be

around um the persuasive ability of

these models and the ability for them to

affect elections next year and I think

we're going to really confront something

quite challenging so what's that going

to look

like you could have so so right now um

there like troll farms and whatever

foreign country who are trying to

interfere with our elections they make

one great Meme and that spreads out and

all of us see the same thing on Twitter

Facebook or

whatever that'll continue to happen and

that'll get better but a thing that I'm

more concerned about is what happens if

an AI reads everything you've ever

written online all every article every

tweet every everything and then right at

the exact moment sends you one message

customized for you that really changes

the way you think about the world um

that's like a new kind of interference

that just wasn't possible before AI I

find in most conversations with you

people are processing Their Fear so if

you'll allow me um is is AI good or bad

for

media

one thing I always say is no one knows

what happens next I think the way

technology goes predictions are often

wrong the future is like subtle and

nuanced and dependent on many branching

probabilities uh so the honest answer is

I don't know but I think it's going to

be more good than bad it will be bad in

all sorts of ways but I think it Nets

out to something good as people have

more free time um more attention and

also care more about the people they

trust to help them make sense of the

world to help them decide what to trust

and how to think about a complicated

issue I I think they're going to rely

and care more about their relationship

with someone in the media more and more

and care more about high quality

information in a world of like massive

amounts of generated content so I think

it should be net good but it will be

different how do you think about your

company's role and your role in helping

to preserve an ecosystem where high

quality information

remains it's obviously super important

to us the but that's like a sort of

empty statement um the kinds of things

that we try to do are build tools that

are helpful to people I if to people in

media people in other Industries if if

you had asked us five years ago what was

going to happen we would have said we

will be able to build you know trusted

responsible AI but fundamentally it's

going to be going off and doing its

thing and now I think we see a path to

what we do is instead build tools for

people and we put these tools out into

the world and People Media or otherwise

use them to architect the future and

that is the most optimistic thing I

think we have discovered in our history

and the the safety story changes in that

world the way that we are responsible

actor in society changes in that World

um I think we now see a path where we

just Empower everyone on Earth to do

what they do more and better uh and

that's That's so exciting that's so

different than how I thought AI was

going to go but I'm so happy about it

speaking about where AI is going to go

um one of the challenges I think we had

in in talking about the work that you've

done and that open AI is doing is

helping people understand your vision of

of what artificial general intelligence

means for our future and so can you help

this room understand how their lives

will be changed you said you can't

predict the future but as we move

forward you know what will AGI mean for

all of

us I think the two I mean there's many

like important forces towards the future

but I think the two most important ones

are artificial intelligence and energy

um if we can make abundant intelligence

for the world and if we can create

abundant energy then our ability to have

amazing ideas for our children to like

teach themselves more than ever before

for people to be more productive to

offer better healthare to uplift the

economy um and to actually put those

things into action with energy I think

those are

two massive massive

things now they come with downsides and

so it's on us to figure out how to make

this safe and how to like responsibly

put this in the hands of people but I

think we see a path now where the world

gets much more abundant and much better

every year and people have the ability

to do

way way more than we can possibly

imagine today and I think we're I think

2023 was the year we started to see that

20124 we'll see way more of it and by

the time like the end of this decade

rolls around um I think the world is

going to be in a unbelievably better

place it sounds sort of like silly and

sci-fi optimism to say this but if if

you think about how different the world

can be not only when every person has a

you know today they have like chat gbt

it's like not very good um um but next

they have like the world's best chief of

staff and then after that every person

has like a company of 20 or 50 experts

that can work super well together and

then after that everybody has a company

of 10,000 experts in every field that

can work super well together and if

someone wants to go focus on curing

disease they can do that and if someone

wants to focus on making great art they

can do that but if if you think about

you know the cost of intelligence and

the the quality of intelligence

the cost falling the quality increasing

by a lot and what people can do with

that it's like a very different world

it's the world that sci-fi has promised

us for a long time and and for the first

time I think we get to start to like see

what that's going to look like two quick

questions to to wrap up this

conversation and again thank you for

being here uh disqualify yourself in

consideration and remember there are a

lot of CEOs in the room tonight who

should be the the 2023 CEO of the year

if not

you there are a lot of good choices for

that

um I mean I I I'm hugely biased on this

I do think uh AI was sort of the

most exciting impactful thing to happen

this year so I'd give it to one of the

other AI companies but I'm like really

biased smooth answer

um uh a much harder question to end this

conversation uh what is your favorite

Taylor Swift

song uh that is a hard question to pick

like a not super popular one I would say

wildest dreams okay but

oh they like that but all of the like

all of the super popular ones are great

too uh well Sam Alman times 2023 CEO of

the Year thank you very thank you very

much thank

you
