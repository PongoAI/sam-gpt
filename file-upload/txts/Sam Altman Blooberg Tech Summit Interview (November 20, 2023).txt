MY GUEST NOW IS THE ONE AND
ONLY PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE

DECIDING OUR FUTURES. BRAD:
I DON'T THINK SO. [APPLAUSE]

EMILY: YOU HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE.
>> THAT WAS A LONG TRIP.

EMILY: YOU WERE IN RIO, TOKYO.

WHAT SURPRISED YOU MOST?

>> A LOT.
IT IS LIKE A VERY SPECIAL

EXPERIENCE TO GO TALK TO PEOPLE
THAT ARE USERS, DEVELOPERS, SO

RULED LEADERS INTERESTED IN AI.
YOU REALLY GET AN UNDERSTANDING

OF WHAT IS GOING ON.
I THINK THE BIGGEST SURPRISE

WAS THE LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT,
OPTIMISM, BELIEF IN THE FUTURE

AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO MEAN
EVERYWHERE.

I KIND OF KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE
IN THE BAY AREA AND IT WAS MUCH

MORE INTENSE EVERYWHERE ELSE.
EMILY:

MORE EXCITEMENT THAN ANXIETY?

>> ANXIETY, TOO, AS THERE
SHOULD BE.

YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH.
BUT JUST THE THOUGHTFULNESS,

THE UNDERSTANDING, THE NUANCE,
THE TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO.

THAT EXISTS EVERYWHERE AND
PEOPLE'S DESIRE TO REALLY

FIGURE OUT HOW TO DRIVE SOCIAL
WITH THIS TECH AND WHAT IT WILL

TAKE TO COME TOGETHER AS A
PLANET TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE

AVOID SOME OF THE DOWNSIDE
SCENARIOS WAS QUITE

SOPHISTICATED. EMILY:
HOW MIGHT YOU CHANGE YOUR

APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
AI AS A RESULT OF WHAT YOU

LEARNED?

>> THERE'S A BUNCH OF SPECIFIC
FEEDBACK, MORE THAN 100 PAGES

OF NOTES FROM MEETING WITH
DEVELOPERS ABOUT COMPLAINTS

PEOPLE HAVE OR THINGS THEY WANT.
EMILY:

I SAW YOU TAKING HANDWRITTEN
NOTES.

>> I DO TAKE HANDWRITTEN NOTES.
THERE IS ALL OF THAT AND THERE

IS SORT OF THE WAY PEOPLE WANT
TO CUSTOMIZE THE TOOLS, MAKE

SURE THEIR OWN VALUES, CULTURE,
HISTORY, LEG WHICH ARE

REPRESENTED IN WHAT WE HAVE TO
DO TO ENABLE THAT.

THERE WILL BE A BUNCH OF
SPECIFIC CHANGES WE WILL GO

MAKE.

AND THEN THE DESIRE FOR THE
WORLD TO COOPERATE, LIKE THE

NUMBER OF WORLD LEADERS WHO
WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE I THINK

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, WE
WENT TO GET AGI RIGHT, TELL ALL

OF THE OTHER WORLD LEADERS I AM
IN ON IT AND WORK TOGETHER.

THEY CAME UP MAYBE EVERY TIME
BUT ONE. EMILY:

YOU SIGNED A 22 WORD STATEMENT
WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AI.

A REIT'S OF MITIGATING THE RISK
OF EXTINCTION FROM AI SHOULD BE

A GLOBAL PRIORITY ALONGSIDE
OTHER SUBTLE SKILL RISKS THAT

JUST PANDEMICS AND NUCLEAR WAR."
CONNECT THE DOTS FOR US.

HOW DO WE GET FROM A COOL
CHATBOT TO THE END OF HUMANITY?

>> WE ARE PLANNING NOT TO.
EMILY:

THAT IS THE HOPE, BUT THERE'S
ALSO THE FEAR.

>> I THINK ARE MANY WAYS IT
COULD GO WRONG BUT WE WORK WITH

POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE
USED IN DANGEROUS WAYS VERY

FREQUENTLY IN THE WORLD.
AND I THINK WE HAVE DEVELOPED

OVER THE DECADES GOOD SAFETY
SYSTEM PRACTICES IN MANY

CATEGORIES. IT IS NOT PERFECT.
THINGS WILL GO WRONG.

BUT I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO
MITIGATE SOME OF THE WORST

SCENARIOS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

BIOTERRORIST, CYBERSECURITY.
MANDY MOORE WE COULD TALK ABOUT.

-- MANY MORE WE COULD TALK
ABOUT. THE MAIN THING I FEEL IS

IMPORTANT THROUGHOUT THIS
TECHNOLOGY IS WE ARE ON AN

EXPONENTIAL CURVE AND A
RELATIVELY STEEP ONE.

HUMAN INTUITION FOR EXPONENTIAL
CURVES IS REALLY THAT IN

GENERAL. IT CLEARLY WAS NOT THAT
IMPORTANT IN OUR EVOLUTIONARY

HISTORY.
SO I THINK WE HAVE -- GIVEN WE

HAVE THAT WEAKNESS, GET TO

REALLY PUSH OURSELVES TO SAY,
OK, GPT4, HOW SURE ARE WE THE

GPT9 WON'T BE?
IF THERE IS EVEN A SMALL

PERCENTAGE CHANCE IT WILL BE
BAD. EMILY:

IF THERE IS THAT SMALL
PERCENTAGE CHANCE, WHY KEEP

DOING THIS AT ALL? WHY NOT STOP?
>> A BUNCH OF REASONS.

I THINK THE UPSIDES HERE ARE
TREMENDOUS, THAT OPPORTUNITY

FOR EVERYONE ON EARTH TO HAVE A
BETTER QUALITY EDUCATION THAT

BASICALLY ANYONE CAN GET TODAY,
THAT SEEMS REALLY IMPORTANT.

MEDICAL CARE AND WHAT I THINK
IS GOING TO HAPPEN THERE,

MAKING THAT AVAILABLE TRULY
GLOBALLY. THAT IS GOING TO BE

TRANSFORMATIVE.
THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS WE ARE

GOING TO SEE.
I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT REAL

SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL
THE OF LIFE COME FROM

SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGICAL
PROGRESS AND I THINK WE WILL

HAVE A LOT MORE OF THAT.
THERE ARE THE OBVIOUS BENEFITS.

I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO END
POVERTY.

BUT WE HAVE TO MANAGE THROUGH
THE RISK TO GET THERE.

I ALSO THINK AT THIS POINT,
GIVEN HOW MUCH PEOPLE SEE THE

ECONOMIC BENEFITS POTENTIAL, NO
COMPANY WOULD STOP IT.

THE GLOBAL REGULATION, WHICH
ONLY THINK SHOULD BE ON THESE

POWERFUL EXISTENTIAL RISK LEVEL
SYSTEMS -- OVERREGULATION IS

HARD.
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT FOR

SURE.
BUT I THINK GLOBAL REGULATION

CAN HELP MAKE IT SAFE, WHICH IS
A BETTER ANSWER THAN STOPPING

IT. I DON'T THINK STOPPING WOULD
WORK. EMILY:

LET'S TALK ABOUT GLOBAL
REGULATION.

YOU HAVE MET WITH PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND THE CEOS OF MICROSOFT

AND GOOGLE, AND YOUR CONQUER
REGULATION BUT WITH CAVEATS.

THE CRITICS SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE SAYING, REGULATE US BUT

NOT REALLY.
OR THAT YOU ARE CALLING FOR

REGULATION IN PUBLIC BUT
LOBBYING FOR SOMETHING ELSE IN

PRIVATE.
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

>> WE ARE PUSHING FOR IN
PRIVATE, TOO.

OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE THINGS ABOUT
WAY TO DO IT THAT WILL BE

EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE.
WE, FOR EXAMPLE, DON'T THINK

SMALL STARTUPS AND OPEN-SOURCE
BLOWS AND HIKE OF ABILITY

THRESHOLD SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO
A LOT OF REGULATION.

WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS TO
COUNTRIES THAT TRY TO OVERRATE

-- OVER REGULATE TECH.

BUT ALSO, WE THINK IT IS SUPER
IMPORTANT THAT AS WE THINK

ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT COULD GET A
RISK LEVEL LIKE YOU'RE TALKING

ABOUT, THAT WE HAVE A GLOBAL
AND COORDINATED RESPONSE AS

POSSIBLE SO WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THAT PUBLICLY,

PRIVATELY.
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT.

YOU COULD POINT OUT WE ARE
TRYING TO DO REVELATORY CAPTURE

HERE, WHATEVER, BUT I JUST -- I
THINK THAT IS SO TRANSPARENTLY

INTELLECTUAL HE DISHONEST, I
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RESPOND.

EMILY:
THERE IS THE SKEPTIC'S VIEW

YOUR BUILDING THESE RARE ASHLEY
SHOULD SHIPS WITH REGULATORS

AND IT IS GOING TO BOX OTHER
STARTUPS.

>> THAT IS WHAT I MEANT ABOUT
THE REGULATORY CAPTURE.

WE ARE SAYING EXPLICITLY SHOULD
NOT REGULATE SMALL STARTUPS.

IT IS A BURDEN ON THEM THAT WE
DON'T WANT IN SOCIETY. EMILY:

WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE
CERTIFICATION SYSTEM OF AI?

>> I THINK THERE SOME VERSION
THAT IS REALLY GOOD.

I THINK PEOPLE TRAINING MODELS
THAT ARE WAY ABOVE ANY MODEL

SCALE WE HAVE TODAY, BUT ABOVE
SOME CERTAIN CAPABILITY

THRESHOLD -- I THINK YOU NEED
TO GO THROUGH CERTIFICATION

PROCESS FOR THAT.
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE

EXTERNAL AUDITS AND SAFETY
TEST. WE DO THIS FOR LOTS OF

INDUSTRIES WHERE WE CARE ABOUT
SAFETY. EMILY:

ELON MUSK WAS SCARED OF GOOGLE.
IS GOOGLE STILL A THREAT?

>> GOOGLE IS UNBELIEVABLY
COMPETENT AND IT SEEMS LIKE

THEY'RE FOCUSED WITH AN
INTENSITY. EMILY:

SO THEY ARE STILL SCARY?

>> THEY ARE A COMPANY THAT I
DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD EVER

WRITE OFF. EMILY:
WE HAVE SEEN NEW BARBS YOU AND

ELON HAVE BEEN TRADING IN
PUBLIC AND IN INTERVIEWS.

>> I DON'T REALLY -- EMILY: YOU
ARE RESPONDING.

YOU ARE RESPONDING TO PEOPLE
ASKING LIKE PEOPLE LIKE ME.

WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS SO
FRUSTRATED OR DISAPPOINTED WITH

THE DIRECTION THAT OPENAI HAS
GONE?

>> I MEAN, YOU SHOULD ASK HIM.
HE CAN GIVE YOU BETTER ANSWER.

I CAN SPECULATE.

I AM HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

I THINK HE REALLY CARES ABOUT
AI SAFETY A LOT, AND I THINK

THAT IS WHERE IT IS COMING FROM.
A GOOD PLACE.

WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION ON SOME PARTS BUT WE

BOTH CARE ABOUT THAT.
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

THE WORLD HAVE THE MAXIMAL
CHANCE. EMILY:

YOU'RE NOT WORRIED HE'S GOING
TO CALL YOU OUT, CALL YOU TO

COME TO SOME CAGE MATCH IN THE
VEGAS OCTAGON LIKE HE JUST DID

WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG?

>> I WILL GO WATCH IT AND ZUCK
DID THAT. EMILY:

MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF THE
MICROSOFT RELATIONSHIP.

IT IS NOT JUST HIM, BUT HE HAS
SAID HE IS WORRIED MICROSOFT

HAS MORE CONTROL THAN THE
LEADERSHIP AT OPENAI HAS.

>> I THINK WHAT HE MEANS IS
THEY COULD BREAK THE CONTRACT

AND TAKE AWAY OUR ACCESS TO THE
DATA CENTER. EMILY:

AND A LOT OF MONEY THAT YOU
HAVE ACCESS TO.

>> WE HAVE MONEY, IT IS THE
DATA CENTER THEY OPERATE. EMILY:

HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE
RELATIONSHIP?

>> WE THINK IT IS GREAT.
ANY DEEP COMP LOOKS

RELATIONSHIP, IT IS NOT WITHOUT
ITS CHALLENGES BUT IT IS REALLY

GREAT.
IT IS BY FAR THE BEST MAJOR

PARTNERSHIP I HAVE EVER BEEN A
PART OF.

IT IS KIND OF LIKE -- ON BOTH
SIDES, IT WAS A CRAZY THING TO

JUMP INTO.
SURPRISING IT WORKS THIS WELL.

BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESULT,
WE ARE VERY HAPPY. EMILY:

IN 2018 COME THE LAST TIME WE
TALK IN PERSON, YOU TOLD ME YOU

THOUGHT AI WOULD HELP US BE OUR
BEST BUT ALSO STOP OUR WORST

IMPULSES.

WHAT MAKES YOU COMPETENT ABOUT
THAT BECAUSE SO MANY TIMES,

TIME AND TIME AGAIN, IF IT
PSYCH TECHNOLOGY HAS ONLY

AMPLIFIED -- TECHNOLOGY HAS
ONLY AMPLIFIED OUR WORST. >>

WILL DO BAD THINGS, TOO.
I DON'T HAVE THIS ONLY VIEW OF

IT, I HAVE A REALISTIC VIEW.
IT IS HUMAN NATURE TO TALK

ABOUT THE BAD MORE THAN THE
GOOD.

I THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT OTHER
TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE DONE A

LOT OF GOOD AND PLENTY OF HARM
AND TALK 99% ABOUT THE HARM AND

1% ABOUT THE GOOD.
I DID THAT, TOO.

THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
IN 2018, THAT WAS WAY BEFORE

THE GPT SERIES WAS A THING SO
AT THAT POINT WE HAD SOME

INKLING IT WOULD GO LIKE THIS,
WE CERTAINLY DID NOT KNOW

EXACTLY.
BUT I THINK WHAT WE ARE HEADING

TO IS THIS PERSONAL TOOL THAT
CAN HELP YOU IN WHATEVER WAY

YOU WOULD LIKE.
ONE OF THE FUN PARTS OF THE

TRIP WAS HOW DIVERSE AND BROAD
THE STORIES ARE OF HOW PEOPLE

ARE USING IT AT WHATEVER THEY
WANT TO BE BETTER AT AND HELP

THEM.

I THINK IF YOU GO TALK TO
CHATGPT USERS, WILL FIND A LOT

OF SUPPORT AND YOU CAN ALSO
FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE MISUSING IT.

EMILY:
THE REALITY IS YOUR BUILDING IS

ON THE BACK OF HUMAN DATA, THAT
IS BIASED, RACIST, SEXIST,

EMOTIONAL, THAT IS WRONG.
A LOT IS WRONG.

HOW DO YOU SAFEGUARD AGAINST
THAT?

>> THERE WAS A RECENT STUDY
THAT GPT4, THE MODEL THAT IS

RELEASED, IS LESS BIASED ON
IMPLICIT BIAS TO TEST EVEN FOR

HUMANS WHO THINK THEY HAVE
REALLY TRAINED THEMSELVES TO BE

GOOD AT THIS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MODEL THAT

COMES OUT OF THE PRETRAINING
PROCESS, THAT MODEL WILL BE

QUITE BIASED AND WILL REFLECT
THE INTERNET.

BUT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
HUMAN FEEDBACK, ONE OF THE

TECHNIQUES WE USE TO ALIGN THE
MODELS, WORKS QUITE WELL.

IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROGRESS
FROM MODEL TO MODEL, EVEN SOME

OF OUR BIGGEST CRITICS ARE
LIKE, WOW, THEY HAVE GOTTEN A

LOT OF THE BIAS OUT OF THE
MODELS.

I THINK IT CAN BE A FORCE FOR
REDUCING BIAS IN THE WORLD, NOT

FOR ENHANCING IT.
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

IF THE USER WANTS TO USE THE
MODEL IN A BIASED WAY?

HOW MUCH CONTROL DO YOU GET A
USER?

WHO DECIDES THAT LIMITS OF THE
VALUE SYSTEM?

THAT WILL BE A TOUGH QUESTION
FOR SOCIETY TO WRESTLE WITH.

THERE IS NOT A ONE SENTENCE
BUTTONED UP ANSWER, BUT THE

TECHNOLOGY I THINK HAS GONE
MUCH FURTHER THAN PEOPLE

THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO IN
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ALIGN

THESE MODELS TO BEHAVE IN
CERTAIN WAYS. EMILY:

WE HAVE BEEN TALKING GOING BACK
TO YOUR DAYS AT N.Y.C.

AND IT HAS BEEN FUN TO WATCH
THAT JOURNEY.

I THINK PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO
UNDERSTAND YOUR INCENTIVES AND

DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND
YOUR INCENTIVES.

PEOPLE ARE PERPLEXED.
THERE PERPLEXED YOU HAVE NO

EQUITY.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE?

IS THERE ANY FINANCIAL
STRUCTURE WHEREBY YOU DO

BENEFIT IF OPENAI IS A BIG
THING?

>> I GET WHY PEOPLE ARE
PERPLEXED ABOUT THIS, AND I

HAVE WONDERED IF I SHOULD JUST
TAKE ONE SHARE OF EQUITY SO I

NEVER HAVE TO ANSWER THIS
QUESTION AGAIN. A FEW THINGS.

ONE, WE ARE GOVERNED BY
NONPROFIT WHICH I AM A BOARD

MEMBER AND OUR BOARD NEEDS TO
HAVE A MAJORITY OF

DISINTERESTED INVESTORS.
LIKE, DON'T HAVE EQUITY IN THE

COMPANY.
I ORIGINALLY DID NOT DO IT FOR

THAT REASON. EMILY:

BUT ARE THERE ANY FINANCIAL
INCENTIVES?

LIKE ON A CERTAIN BENCHMARK?

>> NO.
I HAVE A TINY BIT OF INVESTMENT

BUT IT IS IMMATERIAL. EMILY:

IF OPENAI IS MASSIVELY
PROFITABLE, YOU WON'T BENEFIT

FINANCIALLY?

>> ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS I HAVE
LEARNED FROM QUESTIONS LIKE

THIS IS THIS CONCEPT OF HAVING
ENOUGH MONEY IS NOT SOMETHING

THAT IS EASY TO GET ACROSS TO
OTHER PEOPLE. EMILY:

IT IS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND. [APPLAUSE]

>> I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.
I'M GOING TO MAKE WAY, WAY MORE

FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS.

IF I JUST HAD TAKEN THE EQUITY,
PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE, THAT

MAKES SENSE.

THEY GOES TO THE NONPROFIT AND
I TRUST THE PROPHET TO DO A

GOOD THING WITH IT, BUT I HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

WHAT I WANT MORE OF IS AN
INTERESTING LIFE IMPACT.

I STILL GET A LOT OF SELFISH
BENEFIT FROM THIS LIKE, WHAT

ELSE AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY
TIME? THIS IS REALLY GREAT.

I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE
INTERESTING LIFE THAN THIS ONE

AND A MORE INTERESTING THING TO
WORK ON.

I GET A TON OF BENEFIT BUT,
YES, SOMEHOW THIS IDEA OF

HAVING -- IT DOESN'T COMPETE
FOR PEOPLE. EMILY:

IS THAT ABOUT POWER? CONTROL?

>> I WANT TO MAKE MY
CONTRIBUTION BACK TO HUMAN

TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.
I GET TO BENEFIT FROM ALL OF

THIS STUFF THAT PEOPLE DID
BEFORE.

I GET TO USE THIS IPHONE THAT I
STILL MARVEL AT EVERY DAY, ALL

OF THE WORK THAT HAD TO GO INTO
THAT.

THOSE PEOPLE, I DON'T KNOW WHO
THEY ARE, I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO

THEM.
THEY KNEW THEY WERE NEVER GOING

TO GET RECOGNITION FOR ME
PERSONALLY, BUT THEY ALSO

WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO
CONTRIBUTE. AND SO DO I.

I CAN'T IMAGINE BETTER
COMPENSATION OR FEELING.

IT WOULD BE MAYBE WEIRD IF I
HAD NOT ALREADY MADE A BUNCH OF

MONEY AND PLANNED TO MAKE WAY
MORE FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS.

I JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

-- I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE
LIKE, I THINK IT WILL JUST BE

THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP YET
THAT HUMANITY HAS TO GET

THROUGH WITH TECHNOLOGY.
AND I CARE ABOUT THAT.

EMILY:
WHAT IS ONE QUESTION PEOPLE

REALLY WISH PEOPLE LIKE ME
ASKED? SAM:

THE PERSON [LAUGHTER]
DRAMA OF THE DAY. EMILY:

SERIOUSLY.
I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE GETTING A

LOT OF THOSE QUESTIONS. SAM:

I'M ALWAYS EXCITED TO JUST TALK
ABOUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE

COMING FEW YEARS AND DECADES
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY.

EMILY: SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO?
SAM:

TALK ABOUT ELON MUSK? [LAUGHTER]
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT, IT'S

DEEPLY IN OUR NATURE TO WANT TO
CREATE, TO WANT TO BE USEFUL.

TO WANT TO LIKE FEEL THE
FULFILLMENT OF DOING SOMETHING

THAT MATTERS.

IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE FROM
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO,

HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO, THE WORK
WE DO NOW WOULD HAVE SEEMED,

YOU KNOW, UNIMAGINABLE BEST AND
PROBABLY TRIVIAL.

THIS IS NOT DIRECTLY NECESSARY
FOR OUR SURVIVAL IN THE SENSE

OF LIKE FOOD OR WHATEVER.
THE SHIFT HAPPENS WITH EVERY

TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION.
ANY WE WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE

DO ON THE OTHER SIDE AND EVERY
TIME WE FIND THINGS AND I

SUSPECT -- EXPECT NOT ONLY WILL
THIS BE AN EXCEPTION TO THAT,

BUT THE THINGS WE FIND WILL BE
BETTER, MORE INTERESTING, AND

MORE IMPACTFUL THAN EVER BEFORE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AI

AS THE LAST TECHNOLOGICAL
REVOLUTION.

I SUSPECT THAT FROM THE OTHER
SIDE IT WILL LOOK LIKE THE

FIRST. LIKE THE OTHER STUFF
WILL BE SO SMALL IN CAN -- IN

COMPARISON.

THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION,
IT'S A CONTINUOUS ONE.

CONTINUING AND EXPONENTIAL.
WHAT WILL BE ENABLED, WHAT WE

CAN'T IMAGINE ON THE OTHER
SIDE, WE WILL HAVE TOO MUCH.

IF YOU WANT TO SIT AROUND AND
DO NOTHING, THAT WILL BE GOOD,

TOO. EMILY:
BONBONS AND PEACHES IN MY

FUTURE. SAM:
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU

WILL WANT, BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.
EMILY:

YOU TALKED ABOUT AI DECIDING
OTHER AI. SAM:

THIS IS THE CLASSIC SCI-FI IDEA.
THAT AT SOME POINT THESE

SYSTEMS CAN HELP ADDRESS
THEMSELVES, CAN DISCOVER BETTER

ARCHITECTURES AND WRITE THEIR
OWN CODE.

I THINK WE ARE ALWAYS AWAY FROM
THAT THAT IT IS WORTH PAYING

ATTENTION TO. SAM:
YOU DIDN'T -- EMILY: CHINA AND

RUSSIA, YOU DIDN'T GO THERE?
SAM: I DID SPEAK THERE. EMILY:

VIRTUALLY? SAM: YEAH. EMILY:
WHERE ARE THEY ON AI AND SHOULD

WE BE WORRIED? SAM:
I DON'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE.

EMILY:
DOES IT CONCERN YOU THAT WE

DON'T KNOW? SAM:
YEAH, I MEAN AGAIN LIKE

ANYTHING, IMPERFECT INFORMATION
CAUSES CONCERN.

I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BETTER
SENSE.

BUT YOU KNOW, I'M OPTIMISTIC
THAT WE CAN FIND SOME SORT OF

COLLABORATIVE THING AND I THINK
THE THING THAT GETS SAID IN THE

U.S., THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
COOPERATE WITH CHINA, THAT IT'S

OFF THE TABLE, IT'S ASSERTED
AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO WILL

IT INTO EXISTENCE BUT IT'S NOT
CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT'S TRUE IN

FACT I SUSPECT IT'S NOT.

EMILY:
I'M SO GRATEFUL YOU HAVE BEEN

AROUND THE WORLD TALKING ABOUT
THIS ENTER WITH US HERE TODAY.

EVEN YOU WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT

OF POWER AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU? SAM:

YOU SHOULDN'T.
LIKE YOU KNOW, I DON'T, YOU

HAVE KNOWN ME FOR A LONG TIME.
I WOULD RATHER BE IN THE OFFICE

WORKING.
BUT AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME

PEOPLE DESERVE BASICALLY AS
MUCH TIME ASKING QUESTIONS AS

THEY WANT.

BUT MORE TO THAT, LIKE KNOW ONE
PERSON SHOULD BE TRUSTED HERE.

I DON'T WANT 7 BILLION SHARES.
THE BOARD OVERTIME TIME NEEDS

TO GET LIKE DEMOCRATIZED TO ALL
OF HUMANITY.

THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT COULD
BE IMPLEMENTED.

BUT THE REASON FOR OUR
STRUCTURE, THE REASON IT IS SO

WEIRD, THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT
READ -- WEIRDNESS IS WE THINK

THIS TECHNOLOGY, THE BENEFITS,
THE ACCESS TO IT BELONGS TO THE

WHOLE.

LIKE IF THIS REALLY WORKS IT'S
LIKE QUITE A POWERFUL

TECHNOLOGY AND YOU SHOULD NOT
TRUST ONE COMPANY AND CERTAINLY

NOT ONE PERSON. EMILY:

ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD?
-- SHOULDN'T TRUST OPENAI? SAM:

IF WE ARE A FEW YEARS DOWN THE
ROAD AND HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

HOW TO START DEMOCRATIZED
TROLL, YOU SHOULDN'T.

BUT LIKE IF WE FIGURE OUT SOME
SORT OF NEW STRUCTURE WHERE

OPENAI IS LIKE GOVERNED BY
HUMANITY, AND THAT COULD HAPPEN

IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE
ALIGNMENT THAT WE PICK.

IT COULD MEAN ACTUAL BOARD
CONTROL.

WE ARE TALKING TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT I COULD LOOK

LIKE IF WE DON'T DO THAT, I
DON'T THINK LIKE JUST TRUST US

IS GOOD ENOUGH. EMILY:

WELL THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING
WHY WE SHOULD MAYBE CONSIDER

TRUSTING YOU.
YOU HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH.

WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR
TIME. SAM:

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
EMILY: THANK YOU SO MUCH. SAM:

FOR SURE.
