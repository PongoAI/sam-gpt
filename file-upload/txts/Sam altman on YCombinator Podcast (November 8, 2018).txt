alright the return of same moment how's

it going nice to be back right how are

things good this is good you know YC is

gonna be huge next batch yeah

interviewed like more than thousand

companies I'm saying Open has going

really well excited about that

yeah I'm ready for this year to be

winding down but it's been excellent so

I wanted to do something a little bit

different for this episode and just

break apart a lot of your essays so I

went back sounds fun we'll see all right

I have a rough outline with a few

general topics that you seem to have

written about a few times and I figure

we can kind of just go into each one so

it seems like there are several

categories from observing your thoughts

and then choosing what to work on and

then creating actual value once you've

chosen a thing and then pass that kind

of purpose in general like purpose in

your work the first one the first quote

that I liked was from your essay the

days are long but the decades are short

and that quote was minimize your

cognitive load from distracting things

that don't really matter it's hard to

overstate how important this is and how

bad most people are at it yeah I think

it's very easy to spend a decade being

incredibly busy and incredibly stressed

every day and feeling like you're

working incredibly hard and creating a

ton of movement but not moving forward

and I think this is like a big trap and

it's so easy to get caught up in things

that are urgent but unimportant or it is

so easy to get caught up in like the

trifles of office politics and playing

status and power games that don't matter

mm but feel so fun and so important or

or just like random other like [ __ ]

that piles up in life and I've at least

found for myself I have like a like

fixed budget of cognitive output per day

and I can spend that on whatever but if

I let it go on unimportant stuff then I

never have time to get to the

the really important stuff and it's so

easy to get heads down and focused and

sort of mislike

what am i actually accomplishing yeah

the number of people who have said to me

like man I thought for 10 years I was

doing incredible work because I felt

like I was creating a huge amount of

output but in retrospect it was in the

wrong direction um is always depressing

you do need to focus and do stuff but

you know I think it's like really good

to like focus for some period of time

and then step back and think like am I

am i doing the right thing

you also don't to make the mistake that

sort of like the stereotypical Silicon

Valley 22 year old or 21 year old

college dropout says of you know I'm

gonna solve all the world's problems in

three months and if I haven't done in

three months I failed so I'm going to

give up and do the next thing yes and

then they like jump onto some other

project that's bad too so balancing this

is hard but I think like making check-in

to make sure you're working on things

that matter and working on an

appropriate time scale mmm time horizon

is really important yeah because I kind

of wanted to address broadly how do you

even frame that you have a certain

amount of like detachment that you need

yeah so when you how do you step back

when you need to UM how do I do that

I am pretty good about like in my

downtime I naturally just think about

like do I feel like I am being maximally

useful and working on the right things

or are there like like you know should

YC be doing something totally different

than we are today

yeah um like should we be willing to

throw everything out and rethink about

it or is it going well do we need to

scale but I think people find different

ways to do that like one specific thing

I do which is sort of become this annual

ritual I really like is December 31st

every year I take a break from vacation

and I like sit and I write down what

went well the last year what didn't I

look at like hard that I might to-do

list for the year and I write that one

out for the next year and because I know

I'm gonna do that every year yeah I

stress about it less the other 364 days

but but I I think like the fundamental

pattern that has always worked for me is

take time explore

of things try a lot of things try to

have like a beginner's mind about what

will work and what won't work but trust

your intuitions pursue a lot of things

as cheaply and quickly as possible and

then be very honest with yourself about

what's working well and what's not yeah

and in the hard part is cut all the

stuff that's not working and focus down

and down until you're eventually focused

on the one thing that's really working

are the two things that are really

working in terms of choosing I mean this

sort of transitions and to choosing what

to work on and how to create value but

in terms of establishing those metrics

for you know so say you say you have

like you know YC yeah opening eye and

then the rest of your life yeah do you

create similar metrics for each one or

does each one oh it's definitely not

it's like I am skeptical of these like

systems where you try to have like

everything on the same rubric yeah I I

mean the best thing I can say is I've

like I follow my interests I try to

pursue a lot of projects that seem

interesting I realized that most of them

will fail and I don't care and then the

ones that as long as the ones that work

really work yeah so like opening I

really works YC really works I've done

playing other things the last five years

that have not worked at all we should

explore that because I think it's

something that's not talked about and

it's to the detriment of everyone so for

example like last year year before you

were doing a lot of political stuff yeah

I still think that is gonna work I am

that's not let me let me try to frame it

in like fair an area where a lot of

things went wrong at once but in a way

that was really good okay so I sold my

startup when I was like 26 something

like that and I worked the acquiring

company for a little while maybe 25 I

remember and then I took a year off and

in that year which is hard to do it's

really hard to do in Silicon Valley

because like in a place where social

status is determined by your job and

what you're working on like when you

show up at a party and someone says oh

what are you working on and you're like

I'm kind of just taking the year off

like you can sort of see in real time

their eyes like look for someone else in

the room to talk to it doesn't feel that

good but

it's an incredibly privileged thing to

be able to do this but if you are in the

position between jobs where you can take

a year off I highly recommend that I

think it was like one of the two or

three best career things that I ever did

in that year I I read like many dozens

of text books I learned about fields

that I had been interested in I didn't

have any idea that they were all going

to come together in the way they did but

like I learned a lot about nuclear

engineering hey I was starting to work

so I learned a lot about AI oh and about

synthetic biology I learned about

investing that was the year that I

started being like well I had made like

maybe four angel investments before this

that I was like alright I'm gonna get

serious about this and try it and see if

I like it

I traveled around a lot I kind of like

really got a feel for much more of a

feel for like what the rest of the world

is like I met people that were working

on all sorts of different things who

were nice enough to talk to me

I got badly needed time to reconnect

with my friends and family I just got

caught up on life and I just sort of

like helped people that seemed I had

unlimited time right yeah so if I met

someone interesting and it seemed good

and needed help I would just help them

and they would teach me stuff or they

would like offer me the chance to invest

in their startup later and I left myself

unscheduled so I'd like the drop of the

Hat I could like fly to another country

for a conference yeah and I started

doing all this random stuff and out of

all of it almost all of it didn't work

out but the seeds were planted for

things that worked in deep ways later so

but you okay so you both sound like it

it was positive and it was great and you

had a great time yeah but when you say

it didn't work out how I mean like the

individual projects like I invested a

bunch of companies that failed okay I

got really excited about a few companies

I wanted to start that turned out to be

bad ideas for different reasons yeah but

that's like fine because that's the

thing when you're in explore mode you

try a lot of projects and you accept

that most won't work right okay so yeah

I know a few people that have gone

through this and it seems like they

don't always so maybe they say alright

I'm gonna go on vacation and that lasts

a couple months yeah they let come back

yeah I'm meeting with people or maybe

they just immediate

jump into something start researching

yeah whatever's trendy which i think is

like a separate problem where you're

just following everyone else that's a

mistake

usually you it's the constant the crowd

is right sometimes and okay fine but

then how do you become decisive because

you say a year so this is the trend

relatively short their trick is how do

you figure out what to commit to and

when yeah and this is where I think it

takes

brutal honesty with yourself about which

projects are actually working and which

you would like to convince yourself are

working and I've been guilty of this

mistake many times and I will many times

in the future this is a very hard thing

to train yourself to do mm should really

step back and dispassionately look and

say like am i desperately trying against

myself this is working or is this

actually working but I think it is a

muscle that is buildable what clearly

people get good at that it's just hard

because it means admitting failure in

something like every time I make a major

investment in a company um

I am convinced it's going to work you

don't go in expecting to lose your money

or at least you know like I am prepared

to pay for the expected value that I

think it's going to work mm-hmm and and

once you've anchored that it's like hard

to go back and man I was so wrong which

obviously has all the times the best

thing about investing in a lot of

companies is you learn to be you you

it's very humbling you learn to be

majorly wrong very frequently and you

learn that that's okay as long as the

magnitude of the successes pays for all

of the failures hmm I haven't thought

about this before but say you sold your

company and had some money and weren't

thinking about being an angel investor

do you think it's actually a good idea

to angel invested a little bit before

you start something else even if you're

not pulled in that direction um the

things that I think have taught me a lot

about like business are poker and angel

investing so I recommend both of those

fair enough

by the way as a quick

plug for poker so I played a lot in

college like fairly seriously and it's

not for everybody

mm-hmm but I strongly recommend it as

just a way to kind of like learn about

the world in business in psychology and

risk and everything else mm-hmm

did you play like like competitive up

every 101 I went to school on the

peninsula and so I would go down there a

lot you know that's great did that fun

your startup it did not for my startup

but it funded my like living expenses as

a college student Wow yeah yeah I'm

always surprised by the person I mean

there aren't infinite people who can do

this but there are enough people that

actually makes how I would have done it

for free like I just loved it so much

yeah okay did you ever get into the

online stuff like ten hands at once um I

did I did that was not as fun and then

it kind of stopped okay all right cool

so you have all you wrote the

productivity post fairly recently I

thought that was really fun thank you

your three main tips were sleep exercise

and nutrition for like physical

productivity yeah that's like a small

fraction of the whole thing but yes I've

been to the core right because if you

don't have a foundation you're off the

number look it is possible that I am

incredibly genetically unlucky and I

just like these people who claim they

only need to sleep four hours a night

it's true I suspect it's not I suspect

it's not but I like I try to sleep eight

hours or close to it as much as I can

and I get it most nights and if you're

trying to like win on really big

creative ideas much better off like cut

something have less of them yeah

whatever but like for me skimping on

sleep which I have tried at other points

in my life is a terrible trade yeah I've

tried to optimize what I kind of think

of as like my best time you know like I

try not to sell my best time for

anything other than the projects I want

to work on totally I think everyone it

takes people a while but everyone

figures out what that is yeah like for

me it's early mornings or like the first

three hours after I wake up and like man

do I put a huge

anything getting in the way of that

right how many hours do you think you

have good hours every day it's always in

flux but I mean like if you take a

Armadale or something you get 20 yeah

but I don't know if that's necessarily

the best version of Sam Altman I would

say I mean I can definitely like sit

down and be like super productive for

eight hours in the row no brick I mean

go to the bathroom whatever yeah I know

brick yeah which i think is more than

most people can do but on me I mean I

think and get before before I need to go

work out or something but it's

definitely not like sixteen and I think

like the people who say 16 I feel like I

get much more done than they do so I

just don't believe it maybe yeah until

we evolve in someone can I get 16 done

so in your in your broad riding on

choosing what to work on

I love the Hamming lecture I had a time

ago and he's he's so much more

prescriptive than most people are today

which I really enjoy the tone of do you

remember that story about the lunchroom

I do yeah he you're right people don't

talk like that anymore not everyone not

many or not many it's been very

interesting trying to sort of help

create a research institution here yeah

and I do think we've done one of the

more interesting research labs of the

last couple of decades the world isn't

set up to support this anymore and I and

it's a very interesting question about

why but I think if you take one one

thing I've learned from open the eye is

if you sit down and say like our

research goal is to create a GI yeah

that's very far off and very hard yeah

you work on anything you want that is

gonna help us get there

yeah it's people no one said that before

like it's that's hard to do and how do

you manage the psychology of multiple

teams working on things that are all

pointing toward AGI but in different

directions you know like maybe it's

we're about it yeah maybe it's gaming

and then all of a sudden someone gets a

result to

that shift an entire team yeah I think

it's really like I think it's actually a

very similar algorithm to what we were

talking about for how do you have to do

with your life yeah like try lots of

things let people follow their

intuitions and then when something

starts working put a lot more resources

behind it mm-hmm

that's worked for us really well

one other thing from the days are long

but decades are short I I liked your

risk explanation so specifically you say

things in life are rarely as risky as

they seem most people are too

risk-averse and so most advice is biased

too much towards conservative paths yeah

I mean the risk is you look that they're

real what risk actually looks like is

that you look back at the end of your

career and you're like [ __ ] I wasted it

totally and people aren't programmed to

think about risk that way like we're

very good at thinking about short-term

catastrophic risk and we're very bad

about thinking about long term chronic

risk like we worry about you know

nuclear plant meltdowns but not about

yeah like inhaling coal smoke or

whatever and so there's like a very

small handful of people that I would say

like I have taken an interest in their

careers because I think they're going to

like do amazing things in the world and

I try to spend a lot of time with for no

reason other than I want to help them

yeah and consistently like this is the

thing i find myself pushing them on

which is you're thinking about you're

thinking too small you're think about

risk the wrong way mm-hmm or you need a

perspective shift man perspective

shifted that's something I want to write

about that at some point like the I

think as you get older perspective in a

shift in perspective just gets harder

and harder and harder and it's an

unbelievably valuable thing to get I

think this is why people end up taking

like lots of lots of psychedelic drugs I

don't know if that's the best approach

but keeping the sort of mental

flexibility to look at things from fresh

perspectives and new angles man is that

important to hold on to yep it doesn't

happen very often

man it's like losing someone close

you losing losing things for the

psychedelic path has become very popular

and yeah just on reading the research

happening and you know limited

experience here like oh so it's both

abstracting you from your daily habits

and then giving you the motivation to

pursue things that you were kind of on

the fence with yeah I mean I don't think

you need drugs for any of that I think

you just need to commit to do it and

give yourself like a space in a format

and people to do it with on the other

like thing that I found for all of the

stuff that really matters is surrounding

yourself with people who will make you

more ambitious sort of be more and

making more inquisitive shift your

perspective more yeah um is really

important and like basically all people

almost like ninety-eight percent of

people in the world will try to pull you

back and say it seems a little bit too

crazy a little bit too out there a

little bit too ambitious yeah almost

everyone wants you to be average because

it fits their framework yeah it's just

it's more comfortable totally it works

it works yeah has any book you've ever

read on risk helped you understand risk

or is it just through experience playing

poker is one good way to do it and

reading poker books was good like

reading blog biographies of people who

have done like really amazing things I

think is helpful like I love reading

about sort of like the great the big

iron science and engineering projects of

history like like I don't think I'd ever

it's hard to imagine I would ever get

tired of like reading books about the

Apollo program okay so now that like the

the next kind of theme in a lot of your

writings about creating value and say

someone's chosen whatever they might

want to work yeah in your productivity

essay you say my system has three kill

three key pillars make sure to get the

important [ __ ] done don't waste time on

stupid [ __ ] and make lots of lists I

feel like you should have hedged it

you never get to get away from the

things you've written anyway actually I

think it's good well I do fundamentally

like I maybe would have phrased it

differently but I do shall leave

I think people overcomplicate it I think

this that all like productivity pointing

where you have these like systems and

like yeah you know like these multi

variable charts and three-dimensional

whatever's like those people never seem

to be the people who like really move

the world forward I will observe and I

think any system as long as it keeps you

disciplined and getting done what you

say you're going to get done is fine and

I think like the simple ones really work

the one thing I would say is if you're

going to try to like multitask a lot

written lists are very helpful mm-hmm

but beyond that I think like whatever

you find that works for you um is good

and I think like focus and

prioritization are the keys here hmm

yeah I do I think that's true I think

for the most part you know what to do

and you know in your screwing around and

not doing it one thing that I have found

helps people is if they have like a like

a lot of CEOs form these small groups of

like accountability buddies hmm it

happens very naturally during YC because

you have your batch mates and you have

like group office hours and then you

lose it and people feel their

productivity sag and so they reformed

the groups by themselves and that that

seems to work yeah there was this guy

Nick Crocker who wrote this post

elephants I don't know fever snow this

post but yeah it was him and three of

his friends basically weekly emails and

then quarterly check-ins it's very

simple and easy to follow would

recommend it so the the other thing you

talk about in creating value talk about

these like big projects and there's the

this other essay you wrote called what

happened to innovation and I think is

this fear that many people have like oh

man all the cool [ __ ] already happened

when in reality

it is obviously happening but you're

questioning like how can we incentivize

I mean if this one thing works like if

we do actually build a gyro and the AI

that is more important than all the

innovation some total and Humanities so

far so clearly not as all the innovation

happened totally it's an interesting

question of why people feel that way one

is it's cool to like seem sort of world

weary one is people like to complain

another is that it is true that most of

the innovation recently has been in

software like in the internet now I do

think the Internet is like a triumph of

humanity and like that's where the

frontier is that's where the best people

want to go work and so I think it is a

fair criticism to say like most recent

big iron innovation has been on the

Internet and that is a criticism but

it's also a praise and like you know I

think there's usually like a small

handful of frontiers where the most

talented people go because that's where

you're making the most progress mm-hmm

and sure it's not physics right now but

that's ok and I think it's like if you

just look at the rate of change in

humanity in the last decade it's crazy

it's crazy now it is like the Internet

will not solve all problems but I think

it'd be a mistake to say we're not

making progress right

and what about funding mechanisms have

you changed your I mean I think that

post was pre open ai yeah I will have a

lot more to share here hopefully in the

first quarter of 2019 one of my big

projects this year has been how you fund

this stuff yeah and I think we're close

to an answer on projects without without

the same appeal as AGI yeah like well if

it's not gonna create like a lot of

value for the world at some point I

still don't have an answer but rings

that will create value for the world but

on a long time frame in uncertain ways I

think we'll have some new structures to

share ok wait for that yeah there was a

point that Hamming brought about in his

lecture that he said he who works with

the door-open get

all kinds of interruptions but he also

occasionally gets clues as to what the

world is and what might be important

yeah so this figuring out the balance of

how much random flux you accept in your

life

for how much wasted time yeah is hard

that at some point and it takes a long

time to get here you know you get to

like hire a couple of people who screen

stuff for you and that's great

but I didn't have that luxury for a long

time and there's basically two things to

do one is you take a lot of random

meetings and you accept that 90% of the

time you will waste your time and be

frustrated with yourself for wasting

your time

for that one meeting that makes it all

worth it net yeah

but the trade-off for that is you have

to work so much because you got to do

that in addition to your regular work

yeah do you allocate a percentage for

that I used to again I've got sort of

good screen systems yeah but I used to

be like I used to spend I don't know

like 1015 hours per week and like random

stuff and most of the time it was just

painful and sometimes it's so valuable I

think if you cut it off entirely its

disastrous like if you don't have any

like flow of like people outside your

network with new ideas or just a lot of

talent that is under appreciated it's

really bad that's like a key point to

that lecture yeah where's like Nobel

Prize winners only work on important

problems and it removes them from them

yeah yeah yeah so you can't cut it off

totally but if you're not willing to

work really hard I think you do have to

just cut it down a lot okay yeah this is

related I remember it was a funny moment

at the hackathon like last year when you

were there there was some team who was

like we're gonna do this and then we're

gonna do that and then we're gonna work

on rockets or like help work on the

rockets and you said something that I

thought was so great well you're like if

you want to work on Rockets go work on

rockets yeah I don't believe in the

deferred life plan yeah the like a

common criticism of people in Silicon

Valley who I think have great features

in their past are people who say some

version of the following sentence my

life's work is to build rock

so what I'm going to do is spend I'm

gonna make one hundred million dollars

in the next three days say four in the

next four years trading cryptocurrency

with Minecraft a hedge fund because I

don't want to think about the money

problem anymore and then I'm gonna build

rockets and they never do either

I believe if these people would just

pick one thing or the other you know I'm

I I'm obsessed with money so I'm gonna

go make a hundred million dollars

however long that takes

but with it long enough time rise and

then it's reasonable or I'm just gonna

build rockets right now I believe they

would succeed it either but the problem

one of the many problems with the

deferred life plan is everyone can kind

of tell that that's what you're on

mmm-hmm and you're not that serious

about you're not that committed to

either and it just never works I mean it

must work sometimes but I've seen it

fail a lot lot lot and I understand the

temptation of it and I understand the

degree to which people feel well they're

never like I'm gonna make $1,000,000 and

then work on rockets and just raise the

capital right it's always like I got

there people that tend to be obsessed

with like making a lot a lot of money

mmm and I understand the temptation to

like figure out basic financial security

of course like I needed that myself but

like I think one of the things that's

amazing about Silicon Valley is you

actually can raise money as an unknown

22 year old to go make a rocket company

it's happened several times at YC yeah

and so if that's what you want to do

like just get on with it the company

will pay you a salary like you'll be

fine if you can raise money at all

you'll be fine if you can't raise money

like think about something else but it

is I mean I could go in such a long rant

that I will just bore people and piss

people off but I would say the deferred

life plan empirically usually does not

work right and you don't if what you

want to work on is like an ambitious

company and you are in Silicon Valley

and you're competent you very likely

config

you're out a way to just work on that

problem mm-hmm you know maybe it means

you have to go be an employee at space

accents that have been Elon Musk but

like at least you're doing what you want

but that's fine and it's also like

listen dude if what you really want is a

hundred million dollars and you just let

me hear so that exactly just like a call

a spade a spade and make money and but

be willing to like agree that that takes

hold you accept that takes a long time

and you can't just sort of say I'm gonna

compress this into three or four years

and that's why you don't have guarantee

it doesn't warbly you don't have to hide

behind wanting to make Rockets gonna

make money yeah I think many people

actually do want to make the Rockets but

they also you have to like pick one kind

of if you have to like you can't say I'm

gonna do this thing for the short period

of time and then do what I really want

to do or you'll never motivate people to

like join you don't want you to win and

work with you yeah yeah it's like people

can sense authenticity people can sense

people's motivation people can sense if

you're doing something because like if

you're doing something for the right

reasons and I think like to succeed in

anything it's important that people are

rooting for you it's important people

want you to win investors that press

your team whatever and I think that's

one of another one of the many problems

with the with the deferred life plan

mm-hmm yeah people of seemingly like any

intelligence level and almost like any

EQ level have amazing [ __ ] detector

yeah like everyone yeah they do

and again like doing anything worthwhile

takes a long time and it takes a lot of

like emotional trauma like a lot of

people telling you you're an idiot or

wrong or whatever and if you're not

willing to sign up for that you're not

gonna succeed and people can also kind

of sense when you're like not willing to

sign up for that like if you're doing

the crypto fun just to make money not

because you're a die-hard believer in

crypto right people can kind of tell

yeah but even if it comes with yeah it's

not even that it's just like riding this

wave even just like even making money

because if you're doing the crypto fun

to make money that is kind of aligned

but if you're not really into the crypto

part right

but would ya just like something about

it is no I've dude I've had it with like

side projects or I'm like you know

maintaining code for months and months

and then I realize like I don't know how

much I care about this write it but then

it's hard like it's hard to pull out at

that point and you have to write this is

gonna go nowhere right so one of the

last things that I wanted to talk about

is is purpose in work and careers in

general and I think it's kind of related

to eg I will see ya

so you wrote an essay the merge back and

you said our self-worth is so based on

our intelligence that we believe it must

be singular and not slightly higher than

all the other animals on a continuum

perhaps the AI will feel the same way

and note that the difference is between

us and bonobos are barely worth

discussing so this is a common topic

right work purpose ubi even where do you

think that's going in the in the AGI era

if it happens look I think people find

purpose and meaning in many different

ways and it is the only thing I care

about is that people find it somewhere

and if it's in raising a family if it's

in you know running a eSports team I

think that's like as valid as trying to

build a GI the thing I hate is just

people who are apathetic and proud of it

but yeah like I think that the

definition of there are like I think

what seemed to be some human universals

about ways that we get meaning in life

like human relationships for almost

everybody all right like the top of that

list

feeling like we're creating value for

others like feeling like other people

think highly of us and respect us there

are many ways to do those things and I

think one thing that will happen with

this sort of arrival of AGI is

intelligence like I got lucky I got born

in reasonably smart will be less and

less of a benefit and you know like

60,000 years ago like running around

intelligence wasn't that much of a

benefit like physical strength endurance

much more important 60,000 years from

now human biological intelligence I

don't think will be that much of a

benefit again and it's just it happens

to be in a moment in society where it is

really valuable yeah actually I find it

in particular it's out here like

intelligence is so highly rated that

people seem oddly disconnected from

their bodies so it's been cool seeing

you like doing the whole workout plan

now the same Altman gunshow I know how

much you weigh now I think I gained 18

pounds of muscle mass this year that's

crazy you know and vegetarian to do

interested so you're you're heavy

lifting right heavy listen you feel

better I do I do much better than doing

like heavy cardio yeah well the thing

with that like I've shifted over to

lifting this year and I've found that so

first of all you get way stronger way

faster like heavy cardio does almost you

have nothing it just makes you eat a lot

more I was good at bike riding yeah but

like now I actually see physical

progress which is crazy I mean the sad

thing about it is like so I like gained

all this weight which makes it like

harder to run and I'd haven't been

running this year yeah so like I don't

even know if I could run a mile without

stopping at this point

so in some sense I'm in terrible shape

but in other sense like I'm really

strong but they are just they're so

different yeah they're diametrically

opposed there are people online they're

like oh well if you get your squat up to

500 you can bike anything and it's like

you don't understand power-to-weight

right so are you gonna set a goal for

your fitness for 2019 I will on December

31st okay I don't know question mark I

already hit my lifting goals for this

year but I'll keep going to the end of

the year anyway

nice Congrats thank you guys harsh I

think the last thing is like what are

you reading right now the last thing I

read it's really short I recommend it a

lot it's called the way to love by
