there are two strategies to build on AI

right now there's one strategy which is

assume the model is not going to get

better and then you kind of like build

all these little things on top of it

there's another strategy which is build

assuming that open air is going to stay

on the same rate of trajectory and the

models are going to keep getting better

at the same Pace it would seem to me

that 95% of the world should be betting

on the latter category but a lot of the

startups have been built in the former

category when we just do our fundamental

job because we like have a mission we're

going to steamroll you ready to go

[Music]

guys I'm so excited for this I've wanted

to do this for a long time also this is

the first time that you've done an

interview together I think it is yeah

that's right this is going to be the

most unique interview then that you've

done together so this is very exciting I

want to start I spoke to many mutual

friends before and they said we've got

to start with context Sam what gave you

the conviction to to do this 7 years ago

I think they were

two things that seemed well I've been

interested in AI since I was a little

kid um but and I studied at College

nothing was working but when we started

there were two things that seemed really

important one deep learning seemed to

actually legitimately be working and two

it got better with scale we didn't know

how predictively it got better with

scale at the time but it was clearly

that like bigger was better and that

seemed like a remarkable set of things

and the confusing thing to us at the

time was like why does everybody else

not see this and why is everybody else

not jumping on it but they weren't and

so we wanted to do it can I ask when

there were those moments of Doubt from

everyone else which there were across

those years what gave you the conviction

to stick at it when bluntly very few

others had that same confidence it just

seemed to us like it was going to work

and we kept making progress like we it

was not it was I wouldn't call I would

not call it Blind Faith although there

is some amount if you just you know you

got to believe you can do a hard thing

but it it felt really important to us to

do this that if we could do it it would

be you know hugely meaningful

um to the world in some way and that it

might work like we had an attack Vector

we believed in we had uh and then we had

continued data that the approach was

working of course the specifics took a

long time to figure out uh you know we

did not start off doing language models

obviously we kind of knew that if we

could keep doing things that we

previously thought were

impossible that was somehow a good sign

for progress and we had this like

fundamental conviction on the approach

and the attack Vector at a very high

level for a very long time and the

details took a long time to work out and

many brilliant discoveries by our

colleagues there was never any doubt

that AI would be a big deal if we could

do it so that's helpful like it's it's

going to be really valuable um the

approach we got successively more

confident in although it did take some

wandering in the jungle for a while or

the desert whatever that phrase is um

and then you know it's like if you

believe something with high conviction

and everybody else doubts it it's like

slightly motivating yeah it's definitely

kind of annoying but it's slightly

motivating I mean there a VC that would

be contrarian which is not what we do

cuz we're sheep but I I do want to start

on on actually the relationship that we

have here because it is such a unique

partnership and again we said this is

the first time you've been interviewed

together how did the partnership come to

be braad why didn't you tell me that

sure well Sam and I worked together a

long time um and and we actually we

spent a lot of time at YC looking at um

this batch of companies that was

starting to hit the growth stage that

were these really deeply technical

projects nuclear fusion reactors quantum

computers self-driving cars satellites

things like that and I was kind of

focused on those uh on those those

companies um from an investment

perspective and open ey was kind of the

first company I saw that I was like you

know what like this one's kind of unique

because it kind of just seems to be

getting better over time it's not this

kind of binary risk um and I remember

pointing that out to Sam and saying I

think there's something that's going to

be different about this company as

compared to some of the other companies

that we were looking at at the time um

and I ended up spending more time with

Greg and Ilia um and uh the properties

that Sam describes of these systems just

getting better with scale at first kind

of unpredictably and then more

predictably I thought that was just so

unique and um and I think we kind of saw

the same thing maybe somewhat from

different angles uh I saw it mostly from

an investment perspective of if that's

true this is going to be be really

important um just as an investment

outcome just as something that's going

to have real impact on the world um and

so I really felt that kind of conviction

early on and I just wanted to help

anyway I could did you have that plan

that you wanted to join fulltime like

when did that come into fruition that

you wanted this to be your mission for

the next multi- deade it it wasn't at

first I actually was mostly just trying

to help Sam recruit a

CFO Brad actually worked at open a full

time before I did that's true I beat him

there um first time I've beaten Sam on

anything but uh just take it as a win

yeah

um but no I was trying to to help him

recruit and at the time no one wanted

the job um I asked probably 25 people uh

if they would want to be CFO of open AI

which at the time was just a a small

kind of non sleepy nonprofit and I went

over for 25 and honest to God the reason

I'm here is because I was so embarrassed

to come back over 25 that I said you

know what why don't I just help out uh

nights and weekends and uh and that that

turned into fulltime very quickly so I

had no idea about that yeah I was sort

of doing like half my time on opening on

YC wow yeah and there were like all

kinds of you get fulltime YC then some

uh I started doing open a full it was

kind of like a gradual is process but I

think like by the spring or summer of

2019 okay so so Brad beat you to open AI

I I think that great Partnerships are

about complimentary skill sets that's

for sure and so I wanted to hear from

each of you like an All-Star Mr and Ms

like what is Brad amazing at that the

world doesn't know look I think one of

the one sign of like a good partnership

I'm thankful to have this with like a

lot of the key people at open AI

certainly with Brad is like um if you

can't do each other's job you maybe Brad

could do my job for a week I certainly

could not do Brad's job for a week um

and I I think that ability

to divide up as a team um and have a

very high bandwidth Communication

channel with each person and all

together as a leadership team is super

important Brad is good at a lot of

things uh I'll talk about just two here

in the interest of time one is

adaptability uh Brad joined to do

Finance obviously and now does something

I guess it's like in the sphere of

Finance but very very different um we

didn't have a business at all or we

didn't have an appreciable business

until very recently and when it became

clear that we were going to have a very

fast growing business um kind of like

looks around was like really need

somebody we got to we got to get someone

to do this and uh I kind of like looked

around the room and I asked Brad to do

it and it was and he was just like okay

I'll figure it out like I'll you know uh

just like you know I might need like a

little bit of time to get up to speed

but this is you know I've done like

business sish stuff before and can go

like build all this out so the the

willingness to just like take on new

challenges at each level of company

scale and figure it out as you're going

Brad is super great at and then the

other one is

um well I'm like financially literate so

all of that seems amazing to me but but

but to build out a

new product category and go to market

function around that takes a very wide

array of skills and a great deal of

patience

um and sort of uh like a customer

Obsession uh from a product to a

business model to a how we're going to

deal with customer support and

everything else that goes around that um

and Brad's ability to see the whole

picture of that and how it comes

together so that you know a company that

we're here today at this Enterprise

Sales Event I think if you had said a

year ago we're going to be like a great

organization well not yet a great

organization we're going to even be a

very good organization at doing uh you

know an Enterprise go to market function

I would have said uh very low chance

that that's going to happen and now we

have a pretty good one I mean we're

going to discuss it later cuz I think

the Market that You' built is incredible

um if we flip the tables though what

would you say is Sam's biggest strength

that not many people consider or

no well I some people know this but I

think you can say none that's

fine um I'll I'll say two things uh

they're interrelated one is I think at

any given point in a company's life

there's only like one to three things

that really matter at that point those

things change but there there's almost

never 10 things that really matter and I

think Sam has an incredible ability to

be laser focused on those one to three

things and that spills over into how we

run the team uh because if I know what

he's focused on and we may disagree on

what those things are oftentimes I think

we agree but um if we can at least align

on what those things are and they may

not be the right Global bets but they

are the ones that feel the right right

at the time then it helps me to

translate down to the teams that I'm

building on you know whether it's to

that we want to be um you know more

Enterprise focused or it's that we want

to really actually um change the bet

we're making on Research or we actually

want to bet more on One Thing versus

another um or we really need to get this

thing right it helps to keep us moving

very fast um and I think that's kind of

the key to uh to how to to kind of

maintain um velocity at scale that most

companies start to lose inherently is

the number of things and what the

perceived number of important things are

goes up um and the second thing I'll say

is just a long like a very like

long-term future orientation um and you

kind of have this like idea that you're

running at this thing that's like really

far out there um and you're the the

process of justifying what those one to

three things are by the way that's most

important is really just a function of

trying to figure out uh what the one to

three things are that are the fastest

accelerants to get us to that point um

and Sam's has this like maniacal focus

on that future World um my job is just

to to fill in everything in between what

are the one or two things that you think

are most important to you now then there

are a lot of AI orgs in the world that

can um copy what other people do uh like

once you know something that's possible

once you kind of know the r shape of it

once you know that people want it that's

not so hard um or it's like somewhat

hard it's really hard to figure out how

to do something new for the first time

and to do that consistently uh over

years and hopefully for lucky enough

over decades building an research org

and a product org and a whole company

that puts these things out in the world

cuz we also innovate on business models

and anything else this culture of

repeated Innovation so that we're not

just making GPT 5 amazingly great but

six seven 8 whatever we're going to call

those we won't keep numbering them like

that at that point um making sure that

we're set up to do that uh from a

thinking about where the researches can

take us what that means for where the

products got to go what that means for

where the whole company has to follow um

that's a big one what are the biggest

things that would prevent or slow down

the velocity of open AI decision making

Innovation I think we have the best

researchers and best research culture

that I'm aware of in the world um if we

lost either of those things that would

be really bad not having enough compute

resources would be uh really bad and I

think you know we we love doing cool

research cuz scientific advancement is

like the coolest most exciting thing in

the world but really we're here to like

do useful stuff for other people and if

we do the best research in the world and

then we make it as efficient as we can

but we still don't have enough compute

to provide it to everybody on Earth

who's wants to use it and is going to

want to use it so much more as these

models get way better that would get in

the way that'd be really bad so uh the

second thing I was going to say for

priorities uh is think about how we get

enough compute to fulfill the demand of

people who want to use these how do you

think about answering that I know it's

the holy Gra question uh that one I

probably won't answer in front of a

camera but I am optimistic by by

treating that as a whole system problem

um I am optimistic we will really

surprise the world on the

upside good can ask on the decision

making how do you guys make decisions

between the two of you how do you

determine what to get delegate versus

what not to I think it comes back to

just being really aligned on what is

most important and you'll probably just

hear me repeat that phrase but um things

that are kind of specific to or even

tangential to the most important things

we really spend a lot of time on as an

executive team as a leadership team

trying to make the right decision around

sometimes it's obvious sometimes it's

not everything else gets uh gets

delegated so um I probably make 10

decisions a day that don't go to Sam

because they're not the most important

thing um but we will spend an entire

executive team meeting on one thing uh

and then we'll spend the next meeting on

that one thing uh if it's really the

most important thing do you agree with

the saying that it's like one or two

decisions a year Define a company or do

you agree with that you make 10

decisions a day and actually it's all

about the incremental little decisions

that add up to the progress of a company

I'm always stuck between both mindsets I

very much think it's both um I think

there are one of the things that I loved

about being an investor was that job is

really a job about one or two decisions

a year or maybe one or two decisions a

decade and operator role is definitely

not my natural this is not my natural

place in the world by the way but in an

effort to uh get slightly better at it

one of the things I have learned is that

it is true that there are only a handful

of strategic decisions it feels more

like one or two a month than one or two

a year but it's not like that many like

big like here is the here is the what

decisions but the

like the how decisions are there are a

lot of those and I think people who

claim there are not a lot of those have

not tried to run a complex company

before for because it would be

ridiculous to say that any CEO makes one

or two decisions a year or a month um it

is really non-stop but there's a

difference between like the big like

we're going to do chat GPT or we're not

going to do chat GPT and then the like

to make that successful along the way in

the spirit of making that one decision a

successful one here are the 10,000

little things you have to do along the

way why do you think you're not an

operator I mean I'm manifestly not like

I I I was

I was very happy

well I had a lot of fun being an

investor um it's it's it's not a feeling

it was not a fulfilling job for me um

but it's a very fun one and and I kind

of like you know all of the like things

that people say to make fun of investors

are somewhat true like for quality of

life job it's a great great trade-off

um but yeah with no false humility I'm

just not an operator by Nature

I'm happy to do it because I like really

love open Ai and I think AI will be the

most important thing I ever touch but

this is not my natural fit it's just

funny to hear when you think about open

AI being you know the fastest going Brad

would agree I'm sure would agree yeah I

would definitely agree that's all you're

like declined to comment no no comment

on that one I love that um can I we

mentioned kind of the compute element in

terms of like marginal cost versus

marginal revenue how do we think about

when like marginal revenue exceeds

marginal cost I think that's one that a

lot of people suggested that we talk

about today especially with llm based

products obviously how do we think about

that and that could be on both sides I

mean truly I think of all the things we

could talk about that is the most boring

no offense that's the most boring

question I could imagine we will really

why is that boring all you have to

believe is that the price of compute

will continue to fall and the value of

AI as the models get better and better

will go up and up and like the equation

works out really easily there's ways it

can go wrong like if the price of comput

if we don't make enough compute in the

world and the supply demand thing gets

out of balance and we choose for compute

or by a factor of bad planning we cause

compute to be really expensive then sure

maybe that's um the way it goes but I

think we can drive the cost of a very

high quality of intelligence to very

near zero and that will just be

phenomenal for most things in the world

not everything there will be some

negatives but I think I think the cost

of intelligence is about to get really

really cheap how does open source and

the rise of Open Source further enable

that or impact that there will be a

place for open source models in the

world some people will want them um some

people will want managed Services some

people a lot of people will use both I I

kind of think all of these

are details that are like quite

interesting in some sense but missed the

bigger picture which is we are in the

midst of a legitimate and pretty big

technological Revolution where

intelligence is going from this very

limited thing which is you know smart

humans have it but if you like want to

do something that requires a lot of

intelligence you got to get a lot of

smart people to do something like if you

want to make thing like open AI you need

a ton of smart people a ton if you think

about everything in the stack not just

people who work at open a eye but the

people who make chips and build data

centers and all of that to something

where one person will be able to access

abundant and very inexpensive

intelligence to do just amazing things

do you think we overestimate adoption in

a year and underestimate it in 10 I mean

probably cuz I I think that's like

actually a very deep Insight on the way

that technology gets adopted in general

because no matter how amazing something

is societal inertia is just a big deal

you only ever get a lot of adoption for

something amazing but also it takes a

while to get going and so that's I think

you do for something cool you get the

onee 10e thing so probably I think we'll

have a very fast inversion of

expectation reality I think right now

expectations are extremely high reality

is still pretty bad honestly these

models are not that good uh I think very

quickly expectations will start to come

down as people come into contact with

today's models but then very quickly

also these models will get really really

good and you'll see this inversion of

expectations reality where all of a

sudden then expectations have to catch

up my question is you kind of mentioned

kind of actual model quality maybe not

being as good as can be and like

expectation reality the other cool

question which might be a little bit

boring but is just the commoditization

of models and I've never seen it before

where you have like M draw one week so

hyped and then you have you know

whatever B the next and it's like the

transience of different players

being preceded in the meteor is kind of

winning so to speak is so moving every

week is this a game of

commoditization there was a time

when there were like more than 100 car

companies in the US I believe or at

least close to that and if you go like

look at some of the old media at the

time it was like now there's this better

car now there's this better one now

there's this better one and I think that

same thing holds true for most new

Industries I think it's fine I mean it's

probably good uh but I don't think

that's where the enduring value will be

I think eventually it will shake out

there will be a small number of

providers just a relatively small number

you know dozen something like that doing

models at Big scale and it'll be

extremely complex extremely expensive

and the differentiation and I hope we

all continue to push each other to make

the models better cheaper faster and

commoditize in that sense and the

long-term differentiation will not

be I don't think the base model like

that's just you know intelligence is

just like some emerging property of

matter or something uh the the long-term

differentiation will be

the model that's most personalized to

you that has your whole life context

that plugs into everything else you want

to do that's

like well integrated into your life um

but for now the curve is just so steep

that the right thing for us to focus on

is just make that base model better and

better MH can I ask you you mentioned

obviously your time investing and you

know Brad you obviously engaged with so

many large Enterprises around the world

today for me as an investor I see so

many AI companies and I'm not investing

in any applicational AI companies

because respectfully we've seen open AI

come out with products and it's like

well that killed the whole industry um

you know I think fundamentally there are

two strategies to build on AI right now

or startups doing with AI there's one

strategy which is assume the model is

not going to get better and then you

kind of like build all these little

things on top of it um and then there's

another strategy which is build assuming

that open air is going to stay on the

same rate of trajectory and the models

are going to keep getting better at the

same Pace um it would seem to me that

95% of the world should be betting on

the latter category but a lot of the

startups have been built in the former

category and then when we just do our

fundamental job which is make the model

and its tooling better with every crank

then you get the Open Eye killed my

startup meme um if you're building

something on open on GPT 4 that a

reasonable Observer would say if gp5 is

as much better as gp4 over gpt3 was not

because we don't like you but just

because we like have a mission we're

going to steamroll

you but there's a giant set of startups

where you benefit from gp5 being way

better

and if you build

those and AI progress keeps going the

way that we think it's going to

go I think on the most part you'll be

really you'll be really for the most

part you'll be really happy as an

investor looking for an investment

thesis that actually last what are those

that will not be steamrolled that I can

invest in Sam versus those that could be

um ask the company whether uh a 100x

Improvement in the model is something

they're excited about it's actually we

can tell pretty well because we know the

companies that come to us saying we want

the next model when is it coming out

when is it coming out I want to be the

first to try it it's going to be the

best thing for my company then there's a

lot of companies that we don't hear from

on that in that regard um and I think

that's like a pretty good delineation um

is if there's a clear path to how better

intelligence better underlying

intelligence accelerates that product in

that company um they should most

companies can tell that story really

clearly and so like CL would be an

example of that CL is a good example cuz

for clana I mean the numbers are

astonishing and think how much better

that gets if the next model is as good

as we hope it's going to be I talked uh

just this morning to an AI like medical

adviser I guess they would call it um

and they're like you know here's the

places the models underperform in it's

still pretty useful for like these kinds

of things but if the model could just

get like this much better on these

metrics um we'd have all these other

businesses so like can you all do that

faster and then we can have like you

know this like thing that'll save all

these lives and give people who have not

had access to Medical Care like some

access and you know how soon can we get

that and you know here's how many people

are dying every day you delay it was an

effective pitch actually that would

questions beforehand that I was like

I've never asked that that's like a

terrible question and I'm kind of

proceeding to ask most of them so I'm

sorry for this but we mentioned kind of

model Improvement there like how do we

see the rate of model Improvement is it

like linear is it like does it Plateau

at points obviously now it's accelerated

fast and never in the last whatever time

period we want to call that how do we

see that rate of improvement in models

it feels very punctuated

externally which means I think we've

done a suboptimal job on one of

our core beliefs we have this idea that

iterative

deployment um is important and what you

don't want is to go build AGI in secret

in a lab this is like the limit case

toil away for a couple of decades and

then push a button and all at once the

world has to like contend with

AGI and better than that to us it seems

is to put uh you know a model out into

the world let people have some time to

think about that react figure out

how they want to use it what they'd like

it to do differently what they'd not

like it to do what guardrail Society

wants or doesn't want and then you know

build up sort of

more um societal engagement with it and

I

think in some sense one of the most

important decisions we ever made was

this one and that includes things like

deploying Chach PT into the world and

getting the world to take Advanced AI

seriously which we tried to talk about

for a long time and didn't really work

and you know deploying that really did

but as we think about future models uh I

I

think

we underestimated because we've like

lived with these models for so long and

because we watched them get better and

better little by little uh we

underestimated how much even with our

strategy of iterative deployment a Lurch

forward some of these things would be so

as we think about the next models we're

trying to find a way to make that even

smoother um so that it

feels closer to the smoothness we feel

internally uh to the external world do

you think the strategy of it iterative

deployment will still be possible moving

forward as you get bigger and bigger you

see obviously a far and llama released

some on like medical scientific writing

and they got terrible blowback and they

had to pull it away Bard obviously did

theirs and they got an 8% reduction in

share price as you get bigger and bigger

and bigger releasing an imperfect

product can have such

ramifications is that iterative

deployment still possible of a time I

think expectation setting matters a lot

but with the right expectation setting I

think it is possible yeah I would agree

with that I think um we learn a lot also

and so when we release Sora for example

um we get an incredible amount of

feedback from the creative Community

from media from you know from industry

and we actually started now to kind of

incorporate that feedback into how we

think about our research road map for

that you know for that specific modality

and so in a way like we we kind of start

with expectations really low um we just

try and learn uh and we really kind of

just listen to the world and then we try

and incorporate that as best we can so

that by the time we actually have

something we want to share it's

something that really feels useful and

people have kind of natural familiarity

with it um and it almost feels like it

was kind of built more for them um and I

think that's like kind of the the mode

that we'll we'll operate in somewhat

here is uh is this it is really

iterative um and it really is this kind

of more code development with with the

world maybe more than the world

appreciates can I ask one final thing

and then I do want to go into GTM you

mentioned obviously the medical adviser

earlier I hear you've got a passion for

how bnny AI can solve cancer and

specifically certain medical well it's

more like I have a passion for how AI

can help I want to say solve help like

greatly increase the rate of scientific

progress um and curing cancer would be a

great example of that but I I do

generally believe and this is like you

know there's definitely just a personal

element of excitement but I think

science is awesome but I genuinely

believe that scientific progress is like

the highest order bit of progress for

society economic growth quality of

everyone's lives all of that and if AI

can help people meaningfully increase

the rate of scientific progress which I

believe it will uh I think that will be

a

Triumph what do you think is the biggest

barrier to that happening I think the

models are just not smart enough which

sounds like a annoying lowi information

kind of copout answer but I think it's

like deeply fundamentally true like the

models just aren't smart enough you fix

that one thing all these are things get

better there will be all these ways that

we have to figure how to integrate tools

into people's workflow and you know

modelability in different areas will

will matter a lot but if you zoom out

you know doing scientific research with

the help of

gpt2 would have seemed fairly laughable

with GPT 4 people do use it just in very

to to help them do science just in

extremely primitive and limited ways and

with GPT 6 I think people will say hey

this is like helping me as a general

purpose tool in all these ways and then

with gp8 maybe people are like you know

this can do some limited maybe not so

limited tasks for me can I move to the

company scaling because I think it's

really important to cover I mean this is

the most unprecedented company scaling

really in history especially when you

look at speed of Revenue growth Brad

you've been at the Forefront of

that it's it's a terrible question in

many respects

but how have you scaled so fast so

efficiently and what's the secret to

that and things seemingly not breaking

uh well things it's always messy behind

the scenes um but I appreciate you

saying that on the outside at least it

doesn't seem like things are breaking um

well look we I

think we we found a moment with Chachi

BT that it people kind of it was the

first like really Human Experience

people have had with the technology and

we hear stories all the time of like

where people use it and it's continues

to amaze us actually how diverse these

stories are it's like on one second

you're hearing like a research scientist

at a company talk about how productive

it's made them and the next is like this

thing is writing code for me I'm a

software engineer at XYZ startup and the

next is like I'm a new parent and like I

don't know how to take care of a baby

but like I ask this thing 80 questions a

day and it kind of like helps me

understand how to like navigate Life as

a new mom um and like the same tool can

power each one of those experiences and

when you have something that's like that

fundamentally uh diverse um and I think

that uh kind of you know fundamentally

um accessible like it it's just bound to

have a really important impact uh in

like in adoption and you know how people

use it and I think I mean that obviously

translates to a business impact but our

focus is is is just continuing to push

on that front um the the B2B business is

obviously different different different

kind of um Cadence to that business um

there's there's more of an adoption

cycle uh in the Enterprise we've had um

amazing success on the developer side so

we've we've always been a company that

has really prided itself I think on just

we kind of build for who we know um and

so we we've tried to build the best

developer platform in the world for AI

um Enterprises is is a new Focus for us

um and so you know that that will have

more of a uh there'll be more of a

process to building for the Enterprise

but um it's it's one that we're excited

to take on and uh and so a lot more to

come can ask on

Talent is it bad if Talent wants to join

because open AI is the hottest company

it's the fastest growing company

probably so everyone has to join for the

mission because I'm always like does it

actually we always say mission mission

mission uh I mean I think it's bad just

because it makes us like harder to

filter uh it makes it harder for us to

filter I but but yeah like I do kind of

want

people to think that they're doing

something that's really

important um I watched what has happened

to other tech companies when they just

become the place you want to work

because it's a good resume item

and you can like filter against that to

varying degrees um and as you said it

doesn't literally need to be to 100%

true in 100% of cases but I think

companies that lose their mission

orientation um and get taken over by

mercenaries usually come to regret that

it's interesting you've invested in some

of the best Founders are there any that

stand out as ones that you've learned

from that you've invested in and have

shaped how you think about building I

have been extremely fortunate to work

and like be along for a small part of

the ride I think with like many of the

best founders of my generation and uh

and I'm also happy that

the they have been willing to like spend

so much time now helping me uh and can I

push you are there one or two that stand

out and has there been a lesson or two

from them chesy has been incredibly

Hands-On and helpful to me over the last

year and a half uh and is really good at

a lot of things that uh I'm not good at

and have had to like come up to speed

quickly on um how to think about how we

talk about our products um how to think

about how to build great products uh he

is really a special person uh the cison

brothers are incredible and like every

time I talk to them I am like that is a

new deep Insight that I just never would

have thought of it's like a totally

nonlinear thing I invested in a lot of

companies for a long time so I have like

a long list of incredible ERS and that

that are have been like I'm very

grateful to but have been like very

willing to uh really kind of like help

out in different areas and I think in

the same way that I tried to like learn

a little bit each from a lot of

different investors trying to learn a

little bit each from a lot of different

Founders has been uh a great strategy

can I go back to usage you mentioned the

kind of Divergence in usage from kind of

consumers every day maybe it parents

maybe it scientific researchers you've

also built an incredible goto Market

with some of the largest Enterprise in

the world what have been some of the

biggest lessons on Enterprise adoption

and how large Enterprises are thinking

about it approaching it adopting it that

you think are noteworthy I think the

biggest one

is Enterprises have a very natural

desire I think to want to throw the

technology into a business process with

the pure intent of driving a very

quantifiable Roi I know what none of

those words mean but it sounds great I

mean I this is my joke but I can't do I

could iic leas I managed my supply chain

and it cost me x per year and I want to

take Ai and throw it at a specific

process in Supply Chain management and

cut 20% of my spend out of this specific

area that I spend money on that type of

thing and that's great um we are here

and happy to help you think through that

problem I think people though criminally

underrate how important it is actually

and how much like return you really get

on Just giving people access to the

technology and that there's this kind of

because you you can't quite quantify

exactly how it works but like someone

that used to spend 2 days doing

something that now spends 2 minutes

doing something and is freed up to do

like 85 other things in their daily life

that doesn't really show up in how you

would think about Roi as an Enterprise

but imagine doing that now 10,000 times

over 100,000 times over how do you

explain that to Enterprises CU you're

right it's not like a budget line where

you're like oh we got rid of X yeah it's

difficult to show that supply of time

shift yeah I mean part of it is just

having time to show it um chbt is is a

is a business product is still so new we

released Enterprise back basically in

you know late August September of last

year and team is a sell product uh we

released earlier this year so the time

in Market's been virtually zero and

Enterprise adoption Cycles are slower

but um so I think part of it will just

come with time and part of it just comes

with expectations of uh your Workforce

will want these tools and also like

you're going to start to hire people who

uh will have come from a world where

they could only ever use these tools and

they could use as much as they like um

and they will expect to be able to use

them in the workplace uh and so I think

that like over time we will start to see

that shift um but right now I think

that's there's this kind of weird

miscalibration of um of where people

think they should be deploying AI That's

going to have high impact with where I

would say they should be deploying AI

where you think the biggest companies

don't ask that they should

ask questions the biggest companies

don't ask that they should ask yeah

about how to use AI about how to integr

it about concerns that they should think

through a lot of companies think it's

static so a lot of companies think gp4

is the best of model will ever get

that's understandable every technology

they've ever had to adopt has been

relatively static if you think about

like what the iPhone looked like you

know what mobile looked like in 2009

versus today it kind of is the same

thing like the form factors change a

little bit they're faster they're like

higher resolution but like the technolog

is pretty much the same application

development is pretty much the same same

thing with cloud and so here they've

been handed this new technology and I

think their expect is like well this is

it um and I think they don't ask enough

about really how steep that rate of

change is and like what how to think

about like what the next wave of the

technology will be and then the wave

after that um and how to Think Through

implementing that set up for that rate

of change like you know we're obviously

in London now uh European corporates are

not that fast moving um when you change

as fast as you are changing it's almost

very difficult because they get used to

their workflows and processes and then

you change and you update and it's like

oh they're all gone they're out the

window do you see what I mean it's

almost hard yeah no it's it is hard um

and that's what makes our job hard right

is I think companies have a desire to

want to move that fast but there's this

kind of um when you're operating at

100,000 person or 200,000 person scale

it can be really really hard yeah um and

so I think that'll be the the big

question over the next few years for us

Sam you mentioned the research of kind

of culture and the importance to retain

that when you bring in a go to market

function and sales leaders and

wholesales

it's very difficult to blend kind of

product and sales functions or cultures

so efficiently how do you think about

the challenges that one faces I think

this is where Brad and I have a a great

partnership in that we have different

opinions about maybe how to balance any

particular decision and we're I think

very good at deferring to the other

based off Whoever has like more context

or feels like it will have a more

important impact

but we have really deep agreement I

think in a way that many people in

Brad's role wouldn't about the

critical um focus of making sure that

that we let Research Drive product and

product Drive sales now that doesn't

exclusively mean that of course there's

got to be feedback the other direction

and one of the reasons that we love

having users now is this is like the

most important reward signal you can get

for if the model is good or not it's

like how useful is it really to people

like that that's what matters

but we also know that the best thing we

can do to sell more product is to make

the product better and the best thing we

can do to make the product better is to

have a better to have better research

and there's like zero disagreement

between us ever on that and that is

really important it's funny you

mentioned the users that I was Ching to

Alex Schulz from meta before and he said

ask ask Sam about um growth and ask him

how his mindset has been changed on

growth Post open AI because it is such a

a different story I think there is like

Alex Schultz is a legitimate growth

genius he'll be there I'm talking about

this retention curve and the 30d here

and the that and the This Acronym and I

mean he really understands the dials of

things I think you usually don't learn

that much from failure you learn more

From Success um but I think you also

don't learn that much from like extreme

break all the rules on repeatable

success either and what we had with Chad

GPT I would be hesitant to say I've

learned anything at all about growth

like have a once in a generation

technological Revolution that's not

really like actionable advice so if I

wanted to learn about growth which I do

I'm now very interested in it

uh you know Alex probably can't advise

me on it at this point but that's who I

would normally ask why do you not learn

from failure so I always disagree you

learn something from failure for sure um

you learn some things to exclude but at

least in my own experience having failed

at many many things and suc eded at some

uh I have learned much more from the

successes what's been your biggest

learning from a success I mean so many

like what to look for when hiring people

um what you know I've now like I don't

hire externally that often I'm like a

big believer for like my direct reports

I'm like a big believer and try to like

promote into that when you can but

certainly what to look for when

promoting someone what to look for in a

Founder uh I would say like yeah I can

like point to my extremely long track

record of failed Investments and say I

made this mistake here I made this

mistake there I made you know this one

over there Josh Krishner asked that one

he said ask him what he looks for in

Founders cuz the track is so strong well

all of the obvious things and then some

I think some of the things that I look

for uh more than other people are

founders that are going after uh

something that seems big if it works um

I think that is way more important than

people realize to like the really

outlier returns so I'm you know happy to

like lose nine times out of 10 and like

really succeed on the 10th company

rather than kind of like do okay seven

times out of 10 um I think Founders that

are like very good at generating lots of

new ideas um Founders that have like a

very fast iteration cycle obviously like

you know smart and determined and all of

those things matter oh great

communication skills uh are something

that I really look for do you okay but

I've up so many I mean I've

missed so many great companies but I've

 up because you get an engineering

lead CEO and respectfully especially at

seed or series a where I tend to invest

they're not so honed and so they don't

have that communication yeah polished I

don't worry about but like as that great

CEO you like like I don't mean

communication and like can someone sit

in an interview and be like super

charismatic and you know like very you

know hit the talking points and like no

clearly not me either um but but I do

think a lot of the job is Communications

driven like you have to be able to like

explain to the company what we're going

to do and why and you have to be able to

like hire people and get them to want to

work with you and you have to be able to

like sell things to customers and get

people to like try your product at some

point you may have to like talk to wider

audiences so I I don't mean it like

literally as you know can the person

give a polished interview cuz I may make

it my whole life without being able to

do that we'll see um but in the dayto

day you know able to clearly

explain what you doing why people should

care about it what you'd like them to do

to help you uh that's super important

final one before we do a quick F do you

have to ask on the people that you hire

at open a one thing that's quite

striking is they're a little bit older

actually or it certainly appears that

way how do you feel about hiring for

experience versus hiring people who be

new to a job but may have that hustle

and hunger and am I wrong to say that

you hire for experiencing that little

bit older um what do you think I think

at least in my Works where I said hiring

policy and whatnot I there's a

difference between kind of what the

composition of your hires are and kind

of what the composition of

responsibility is in the team and I I

try and keep it keep this kind of um

this team where like great ideas can are

like kind of always elevated um and by

and large actually I would say like the

really really good ideas come from

unexpected places on the team not from

like the most experience end of the the

team always and so that's kind of my

advice is like find a way to make sure

that there's um there's this very very

flat kind of like very very even playing

field when it comes to how you kind of

like look to the for perspective for

decision- making for for judgment um and

for creativity you do need experience

hires I think in that

they they bring a little bit of like a

little bit more perspective obviously um

but I tend to think that like really the

the like company changing ideas actually

by and large come from places that are

not not those hires do you agree I think

there's like some roles where experience

really matters and somewhere it either

doesn't matter or is a slight negative

or could be a big negative um I think

like our leadership team is

probably more like 30s and 40s than the

20s and 30s you would see at other

startups and I think our technical

people skew like slightly

older

um I don't have numbers but you know

maybe I would guess that like the

average age of the technical team is

like early 30s instead of the average

being like late 20s at some other tech

companies I think part of that is just

the sort of like path to becoming a

great researcher there's huge exceptions

in both sides um and I don't want to say

I don't care

about experience on the whole but I

think there's like amazing people with

tons of experience there's amazing

people with like almost no experience at

all I think whatever we're doing seems

to be working but it's not like I don't

think about it as a

like do we want more or less experience

I think it's very much like who is the P

like is this the person

I'll add one thing which is there's a

lot of areas explicitly

where people coming in with experience I

think what we do is so categorically

different like it's it is an entirely

new category the way that people kind of

engage with consume use talk about put

you know put your verb in there uh this

this technology is different so the

playbooks for how you actually like

bring it to the world are really

different there there aren't playbooks

for a lot of these things and so like

the approach you take to solving

problems doesn't NE you don't

necessarily benefit in all ways at least

in my world from people who have done it

for 20 years before yeah one of the joys

in new Industries is it levels the

playing field it does I think you saw

this in crypto in particular where

suddenly 19y olds were just as impactful

as a 45y old because it doesn't matter I

think I think in general if you could

like sample someone at open a eye you

know look at the role they're doing and

the level of responsibility they have

and the impact they have and say you

know what I have expected this person to

be more experienced or less experienced

given that you would say on the whole I

would have expected SL maybe even hoped

that this person was more experienced

are you ready for a quick fire sure okay

so 60 seconds or less uh per question

let's start Sam what's the single

biggest challenge to open AI over the

next 12 months and then 5 years 30

seconds each doing the best research and

the best productization of like the best

Innovation on that stuff uh over the

next 12 months and was it 5 years for

the second thing sufficient like supply

chain and computer Brad what have you

changed your mind on most over the last

12 months I would say actually it really

is that um the I think the rate of

adoption in the Enterprise is actually

going to be way faster than people

realize um I think we will Buck

convention on that people Enterprises

having a reputation as being slow

adopters of technology I think that will

not be true here does that differ by

geography no h do we have loads of

experimental budgets do we have loads of

experimental budgets well we have real

budgets um and that'll help yeah uh Sam

what are you most concerned about in the

world today the the whole thing just

feels like way more on the whole

situation of the world the geopolitical

thing the sort of socioeconomic stuff

politics it feels more unstable to me

than it has felt since I've been paying

attention and there's no like one thing

I would say uh that I I I I I couldn't

with confidence tell you like here's the

the Crux of it or here's the root cause

but the the general macro instability

feels High Brad what's been the most

unexpected thing in the scaling of open

AI for you I think it's how consistently

the scaling of models has worked um it

still breaks my brain uh like I don't

maybe I've been we've I've watched the

same trend line for six years now but I

still find it incredible that uh you can

make these models bigger and they get

predictably better um and that is a

tremendous gift bra what do you know now

that you wish you'd known when you

started at open AI I wish I'd

appreciated the order in which the

technology was going to get have impact

um it it caught us somewhat by surprise

how important the technology is and is

going to be in Creative Industries for

example um relative to more

knowledge-based Industries or relative

to even more industrial Industries um we

were doing robotics really early on and

so I Was preparing for a world where we

were working with robotics companies uh

and building robots and working with

gaming companies and building agents

we've gone completely the other way Sam

what do you not do much of that you

would like to do more of guess time is

not particularly your friendly I don't

really read anymore um I used to read a

lot that's a sort of sad change would

you like to make more room for it it's

probably not in the cards in the short

term but know someday I'm okay with this

trade for now cuz I know it's not a

forever thing but I have basically like

run out of time for real life I don't

really get to hang out with friends that

much I don't get to like do the normal

like life stuff and uh it is both

totally a trade I'm willing to make and

then again it helps to know that it

won't be a forever thing but it is still

just

sad sorry it's a bit of a deep one are

you happy I saw you know elon's I am

really happy I I wouldn't say I'm having

fun but I am really like deeply happy I

have fun that's great good for

you I mean you both also got married in

the last year which is very exciting

that is very exciting can you impart

some wisdom on how do you retain a

romantic relationship a partner

happiness there where you're also I mean

traveling all over the world literally

every day communication I'm still

learning it um it's over communicate uh

be empathetic um and appreciate that

like this job is uh is as taxing as

probably anything uh on Earth um and the

person though that is really paying the

price for that is not it's not you it's

it's your significant

other I I look I just got 10 out of 10

lucky uh Brad the two Chris is really

great but uh I think having a partner

who is just sort of like this is like

not what I always signed up for we used

to have this like nice quiet life and uh

having a partner who is just like

supportive of it who gets it who's like

you know what you go deal with that I'll

like hang out and we'll have like a lot

of time we still like make that's the

kind of the one other thing I make time

for but um having a supportive partner

not not just supportive having like an

enthusiastic partner which is like this

is really important you go do this like

I'll make it work I'll try to like be

flexible around it um I am extremely

extremely grateful did you know straight

away with both of your respective

partners that they were the ones for you

pretty early yeah yeah uh Brad where

will open AI be in 10

years I hate making 10e predictions um

you can have five or

20 that help doesn't make it better um I

mean I don't know

pass I know Sam hates it even more than

me so or we can do a both one which is

like when you look forward 10 years how

do you see the state of the world then

and are you excited for that future

State yes we wouldn't be doing this work

if we weren't excited uh or at least I

wouldn't

but tremendously I hope that people look

back and say we cannot believe how

barbaric they had it in

2024 in the same way that we could look

back a few hundred years or many

hundreds of years and say that same

thing it's like not that we're not all

appreciative and grateful for life today

but you know people get sick and die

prematurely of disease not everybody has

access to a great education not

everybody kind of gets to do and spend

their time the way they want um to say

nothing of like the unimaginable new

things that we'll have in this in this

future uh again it won't be all good I

think there will be like real things

that we lose but on the whole I am

tremendously excited for what a world

with genuine abundance looks like I want

to say a huge thank you for doing this

honestly it's been so nice to do it in

person I so love doing it with both of

you so thank you both for joining me

thank you having us this is great
